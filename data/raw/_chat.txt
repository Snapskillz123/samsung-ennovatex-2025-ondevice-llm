[11/06/25, 3:52:37 PM] ~ Isha Sarvani: Interesting
[11/06/25, 3:52:48 PM] ~ Tanmay: we can do something with ai for this one
[11/06/25, 3:53:42 PM] Sambhavit Anand: ai generated thirst traps?
[11/06/25, 3:53:53 PM] ~ Isha Sarvani: 😂😂😂
[11/06/25, 3:54:12 PM] ~ Tanmay: social graphing the people who cold dm and stuff

and maybe some systems that companies can implement internally based on various factors like frequency of identity changing in profile, or Freq of dming random people, you get the idea
[11/06/25, 3:55:36 PM] ~ Tanmay: this sounds more technical and has more scope
[11/06/25, 3:56:03 PM] ~ Tanmay: however the last one is cool bec it's so random everyone will present similar solutions
[11/06/25, 3:58:30 PM] ~ Isha Sarvani: uh huh makes sense
[11/06/25, 3:58:34 PM] ~ Isha Sarvani: I agree

[11/06/25, 9:11:27 PM] ~ Isha Sarvani: Does any one of y'all know front/back end ?
[11/06/25, 9:11:31 PM] ~ Isha Sarvani: Just asking
[11/06/25, 9:11:36 PM] ~ Tanmay: no I had asked him to form a team with me because nobody else was interested, if you guys want to go then I'll tell him
[11/06/25, 9:11:42 PM] ~ Tanmay: Not me
[11/06/25, 9:12:28 PM] ~ Isha Sarvani: Hm if any other senior is interested we can form two teams
[11/06/25, 9:13:05 PM] ~ Tanmay: both for the 2nd one? Or which problem statement are you planning for
[11/06/25, 9:13:08 PM] ~ Isha Sarvani: Like since there are 4 people interested in juniors and it would be nice to have a senior each cos they are a little more experienced
[11/06/25, 9:13:24 PM] ~ Isha Sarvani: The ai vs ai
[11/06/25, 9:13:39 PM] ~ Isha Sarvani: Two teams for the same thing possib
[11/06/25, 9:13:45 PM] ~ Tanmay: Nop
[11/06/25, 9:13:52 PM] ~ Isha Sarvani: Damn okau
[11/06/25, 9:13:56 PM] ~ Tanmay: also I'd recommend you to go with a JM only team
[11/06/25, 9:14:09 PM] ~ Tanmay: i would've been doing the first PS otherwise 😓
[11/06/25, 9:14:25 PM] ~ Isha Sarvani: The first one full ?
[11/06/25, 9:15:24 PM] ~ Tanmay: yes.

[11/06/25, 9:18:20 PM] ~ Tanmay: Good for experience
[11/06/25, 9:18:38 PM] ~ Tanmay: Last year current SMs went to outstation hackathon for their first event with JM only teams as well ‎<This message was edited>
[11/06/25, 9:19:01 PM] ~ Isha Sarvani: I mean wouldn't it be nicer for someone experienced to guide us along the way so we don't make mistakes and stuff
[11/06/25, 9:19:12 PM] ~ Isha Sarvani: And someone who knows what's going on overall?
[11/06/25, 9:19:24 PM] ~ Isha Sarvani: I see
[11/06/25, 9:19:37 PM] ~ Tanmay: Personally, its a much better learning experience to figure stuff out on our own, but maybe that's just me
[11/06/25, 9:20:57 PM] ~ Tanmay: @918779635194 chime in what to do
he's asking me
[11/06/25, 9:21:22 PM] Sambhavit Anand: hi, in the crypto meet with madhav
[11/06/25, 9:21:38 PM] Sambhavit Anand: will be back to see
[11/06/25, 9:22:01 PM] ~ Tanmay: okay
[11/06/25, 9:22:43 PM] ~ Isha Sarvani: I agree to some extent but I felt we'd get a few nice tips and tricks here and there from the sms , if they are willing to participate, also increases our chances of winning no ? I don't mean to argue or anything so just feel free to let me know the why's
[11/06/25, 9:23:55 PM] ~ Tanmay: Also do note there's only 1 SM interested rn
[11/06/25, 9:24:22 PM] ~ Tanmay: Sure you're not wrong
[11/06/25, 9:25:13 PM] ~ Isha Sarvani: you specifically asked adwait right ? Maybe I can ask aditreyo or kaaviya of that's the only thing that's stopping us but yeah we'll obviously have to call this off if another senior is not interested
[11/06/25, 9:25:56 PM] ~ Tanmay: We need to decide the split for teams and our PS quickly, I'll wait for Sambhavit and Aaron to come
[11/06/25, 9:26:31 PM] ~ Isha Sarvani: Okayyy , Let's confirm with them and go about it
[11/06/25, 9:26:32 PM] ~ Tanmay: No I asked Lakshit to ask if any SMs were interested and then Adwait messaged me.

But I can ask around, do you want me to ask other SMs ‎<This message was edited>
[11/06/25, 9:27:35 PM] ~ Isha Sarvani: If you can ask ai seniors like kaaviya meeti and aditreyo, you can even contact misha , that you be really great
[11/06/25, 9:29:04 PM] ~ Tanmay: I'll ask but we need to be clear on how many seniors we need, I don't want to ask everyone and then it will be a bit of a mess

I'll wait for aaron and sambhavit to come
[11/06/25, 9:29:09 PM] ~ Tanmay: And then we'll see?

[24/06/25, 7:57:13 PM] ~ Isha Sarvani: https://meet.google.com/iwn-uvvm-dpx
[24/06/25, 8:25:29 PM] ~ Isha Sarvani: Some nice resources sharing common ideas we can look into : https://github.com/jvishwa06/DeepTracersV0
https://github.com/deep2universe/DeepFakeChrome
[24/06/25, 8:26:12 PM] Sambhavit Anand: Found this website, we can also call its API : https://deepware.ai/
[24/06/25, 8:26:26 PM] ~ Aaron Fritz: free?
[24/06/25, 8:26:37 PM] Sambhavit Anand: https://scanner.deepware.ai/developer/
[24/06/25, 8:26:44 PM] Sambhavit Anand: yeah i think so
[24/06/25, 8:27:40 PM] Sambhavit Anand: nvm,i think you need to contact them for a key, so paid ‎<This message was edited>
[24/06/25, 8:30:52 PM] ~ Isha Sarvani: we can do like browser recording/ screen recording enabled by the extension is that what i gather, we also need a decent website for the uploading stuff part too incase someone wants to check , also some additional features like reporting/blocking/ using Blockchain based concepts to indentify deepfakes 

Another thing I wanted to add was we can use Blockchain to store hashes of authentic media so that any tampered or deepfake content can be detected by comparing it's hash against the block chain record
[24/06/25, 8:31:59 PM] ~ Isha Sarvani: From what I heard last time anything that involves implementation of Blockchain gets into a different category in hacks , maybe easier for us to qualify ( used as an additional feature here tho) there are plenty of implementations online so let me know
[24/06/25, 8:33:05 PM] ~ Isha Sarvani: @919946169883 @918779635194 please make like a mini report with some resources and implementation details regarding your ideas so we can filter and merge them before showing it to addy
[24/06/25, 8:34:06 PM] Sambhavit Anand: By when is this to be completed?
[24/06/25, 8:35:23 PM] ~ Isha Sarvani: preferably by Tommorow noon so we can give addy flexibility with time , then we can like go on a meet with him and then we'll have a day for us to make the final ppt
[24/06/25, 8:36:28 PM] ~ Isha Sarvani: (bottomline 2-3 hours before the meet with addy cos we need to combine and come up with something solid)
[25/06/25, 4:04:26 PM] ~ Isha Sarvani: @919946169883  when is aditreyo free ?
[25/06/25, 4:04:44 PM] ~ Aaron Fritz: 8pm

[25/06/25, 10:54:59 PM] ~ Isha Sarvani: - browser extension 
- deepfake ai (yt,ig,twitter,articles)
- A decentralized blockchain-based system that hashes and timestamps image/video uploads to make them tamper-evident and verifiable against deepfakes via website 
- being able to report a particular deepfake to the respective platform via extension 
- a linked website in the extension , where a person can upload images , articles , video locally for deepfake detection 
- links / steps for a person to report to cybercrime authorities of respective coutries incase of their deepfake videos found online on website ‎<This message was edited>
[25/06/25, 11:06:39 PM] ~ Isha Sarvani: What I need you guys to do is an Implementation plan , finalizing exactly how we will go about things , code snippets , names of all the processes / ideas for flowcharts related to implementation , details of the AI models and datasets being used as well as research papers / repos if found , if possible screenshots of the models working , the front end and literally anything that can prove that the infrastructure to execute it is already in place

[26/06/25, 11:44:51 AM] ~ Isha Sarvani: this has a bunch of deepfake sampes
[26/06/25, 11:54:47 AM] ~ Aaron Fritz: streamlit
[26/06/25, 12:18:19 PM] ~ Isha Sarvani: features: allow image and video uplaods through a portal , image and video cpatures through theectension , constant monitoring of the scrren , soft ware is airgap , cuts downs bandwidth , model trianed is so leightweigth that it runs locally , streamlit for the local ui ,
[26/06/25, 1:41:15 PM] Sambhavit Anand: Hi
[26/06/25, 1:41:24 PM] Sambhavit Anand: Sorry, just got a break now
[26/06/25, 1:41:43 PM] Sambhavit Anand: @919946169883 @919063011127 Anything that needs to be done, please lmk
[26/06/25, 1:42:04 PM] ~ Isha Sarvani: okay can you call up aaron talk about the technical implementation of the browser extension and everything
[26/06/25, 1:42:10 PM] ~ Isha Sarvani: I need stuff on it
[26/06/25, 1:42:13 PM] ~ Isha Sarvani: And the tech stack
[26/06/25, 1:42:28 PM] Sambhavit Anand: is there a rought ppt outline?
[26/06/25, 1:43:54 PM] ~ Isha Sarvani: Yes there is a template given
[26/06/25, 1:44:07 PM] ~ Isha Sarvani: And technical implementation is one of the slides that we need to fill content in
[26/06/25, 1:44:12 PM] Sambhavit Anand: Ok got it
[26/06/25, 1:44:15 PM] ~ Isha Sarvani: I'm taking care of the rest of the slides
[26/06/25, 2:00:23 PM] ~ Isha Sarvani: @919946169883 @918779635194 are you guys at it ?
[26/06/25, 2:26:15 PM] ~ Isha Sarvani: Come up with the implementation, plan and technical approach and give me content
[26/06/25, 2:26:19 PM] ~ Isha Sarvani: Both of you
[26/06/25, 2:26:24 PM] Sambhavit Anand: ok
[26/06/25, 2:26:38 PM] ~ Aaron Fritz: sambhavith take care of how to make browser extension
[26/06/25, 2:26:41 PM] ~ Isha Sarvani: Please try to get it done by 3
[26/06/25, 2:27:13 PM] ~ Aaron Fritz: I've alr given you info
[26/06/25, 2:27:19 PM] ~ Isha Sarvani: I need content and screenshots if any available
[26/06/25, 2:27:20 PM] ~ Aaron Fritz: on how to everything else
[26/06/25, 2:27:55 PM] ~ Aaron Fritz: don't mention deeptracer anywhere
[26/06/25, 2:28:01 PM] ~ Isha Sarvani: aaron I asked you to give me something written a verbal 3 line statment is not enough to cover 3 slides
[26/06/25, 2:28:08 PM] ~ Aaron Fritz: just say opensource state of the art pretrained deepfake model
[26/06/25, 2:28:18 PM] ~ Isha Sarvani: Yes I mentioned that
[26/06/25, 2:31:36 PM] Sambhavit Anand: ok we can use `CRXJ` but then we need to do it in react
[26/06/25, 2:32:31 PM] ~ Aaron Fritz: we use the deeptracer pretrained opensource to make deepfake detection
we use streamlit deck for the locally hosted UI to make uploads of images and photos
the browser extension will have the following features
capable of constantly monitoring your browser content detecting deepfakes while you are online
capable of detecting deepfakes on command, meaning you can choose when to scan a particular content, image or video whether deepfake or not
the browser extension will also have the capability to launch the locally hosted deepfake detector site where client can upload local files, maybe even social media links
[26/06/25, 2:32:34 PM] ~ Isha Sarvani: I need like a text doc or some shit with all that combined whatever makes sense to y'all so I can put it in the pt
[26/06/25, 2:32:52 PM] ~ Aaron Fritz: this is pretty much what i have on the deepfakes so far
[26/06/25, 2:32:58 PM] Sambhavit Anand: ok so chrome extension mein
[26/06/25, 2:33:02 PM] ~ Aaron Fritz: yeah
[26/06/25, 2:33:15 PM] ~ Isha Sarvani: we need more tech details go through the repos man
[26/06/25, 2:33:17 PM] Sambhavit Anand: there is a default_poput field
[26/06/25, 2:33:22 PM] ~ Isha Sarvani: Perplexity and verify and send
[26/06/25, 2:33:34 PM] Sambhavit Anand: which is basically the first thing you see when you click it
[26/06/25, 2:33:43 PM] Sambhavit Anand: so the page that will be a .html
[26/06/25, 2:33:51 PM] Sambhavit Anand: that can be used for uploading
[26/06/25, 2:33:58 PM] ~ Aaron Fritz: now for misinformation
we can do an on command web scrape of whatever article or topic client is reading and connect to an llm which can verify through online searches
[26/06/25, 2:37:51 PM] ~ Aaron Fritz: locally hosted site: streamlit
model specs: find from repo
LLM used: Groq Playground endpoints, can scale to use better paid models
browser extension tech: sambhavit
Core langs used from my end: python for backend, streamlit python for frontend locally hosted shit, which will also have the llm btw
Explainabilty: honestly not much clue, but for deepfakes we can detect where exactly is the media faked and for misinformation we can make the llm generate sources and reasoning
[26/06/25, 2:40:39 PM] Sambhavit Anand: Browser Extension Tech:

Manifest V3 (Chrome Extension standard)

JavaScript (ES6) for logic and DOM interaction

Content Scripts: Injected into webpages to monitor images/videos/text

Background Service Worker: Handles API calls to local detection server and message routing

Popup UI: Simple HTML/CSS/JS interface for user interaction (e.g., scan on demand, open Streamlit)

chrome.runtime & chrome.scripting APIs: For communication between extension components and injection

Event Listeners: To track DOM changes, media loading, and user triggers
[26/06/25, 2:40:59 PM] Sambhavit Anand: but i hardly know JS so I will need some help
[26/06/25, 2:43:47 PM] ~ Isha Sarvani: can i get more presentable and copy pastable form for the teachnical impleamentation and techstack
[26/06/25, 2:44:21 PM] ~ Isha Sarvani: also both of you figure out how to merge that browser extension witht he rest of aarons report and like give a fianl one i can copy paste there
[26/06/25, 2:44:27 PM] Sambhavit Anand: Like do you want me to explain each part?
[26/06/25, 2:46:56 PM] ~ Isha Sarvani: not the texhstack, the techstack is fine , but i need the complete techstakc including the models and stuff
[26/06/25, 2:47:19 PM] ~ Aaron Fritz: https://chatgpt.com/share/685d101a-7f8c-800e-9ada-2fa3490c3e54
[26/06/25, 2:47:22 PM] ~ Isha Sarvani: somehow merge your browser extension detials with aarons tech plan and stuff
[26/06/25, 2:47:31 PM] ~ Aaron Fritz: i alr kinda did
[26/06/25, 2:47:40 PM] ~ Aaron Fritz: this is the most comprehensive report i can give you
[26/06/25, 2:47:40 PM] ~ Isha Sarvani: okay
[26/06/25, 2:47:43 PM] ~ Aaron Fritz: there are two sections
[26/06/25, 2:47:49 PM] ~ Aaron Fritz: one with general details, the flair
[26/06/25, 2:47:53 PM] ~ Aaron Fritz: and the second is pure tech
[26/06/25, 2:48:09 PM] ~ Aaron Fritz: lmk if anything is missing
[26/06/25, 2:50:58 PM] ~ Aaron Fritz: just verify the browser tech stack
[26/06/25, 2:53:46 PM] ~ Isha Sarvani: can somone et me know if we can add more pages
[26/06/25, 3:17:58 PM] ~ Aaron Fritz: sorry?
[26/06/25, 3:18:04 PM] ~ Aaron Fritz: more pages to what
[26/06/25, 3:18:07 PM] ~ Aaron Fritz: you want more content?
[26/06/25, 3:18:24 PM] ~ Isha Sarvani: no it was regarding the ppt , i had s very descritpibve solution
[26/06/25, 3:22:33 PM] ~ Isha Sarvani: can you give me copy pastable content for Implementation and technical detials seperately , Im confused between both of them @919946169883 @918779635194 , i went through the chatgpt thingy but it looks too ai and doesnt have a seperate implementation,plan and technical section
[26/06/25, 3:31:59 PM] ~ Aaron Fritz: isha
[26/06/25, 3:32:09 PM] ~ Aaron Fritz: you gotta read and understand

[26/06/25, 3:32:16 PM] Sambhavit Anand: Just change the browser extension stuff in @919946169883 s, report
[26/06/25, 3:33:15 PM] ~ Isha Sarvani: Im sorry Im making the ppt, the diagrams ,collected the resources and , did like rest of the slides of the ppt  too I just aked
[26/06/25, 3:33:29 PM] Sambhavit Anand: to this, it's pretty much all there is to it
[26/06/25, 3:33:36 PM] ~ Isha Sarvani: i just asked you to give a technical implementation
[26/06/25, 3:33:52 PM] ~ Isha Sarvani: anyway i used your gpt thing and got another bullet point response from it
[26/06/25, 3:34:01 PM] ~ Isha Sarvani: im sending the ppt over in a few minutes

[26/06/25, 4:45:41 PM] ~ Aaron Fritz: The current system establishes a foundational, locally hosted platform for Deepfake and Misinformation Detection. As the project evolves, the following enhancements can significantly improve its scalability, accuracy, and usability:

🌐 Cloud Deployment & Scalability

Containerize backend and model services using Docker.

Host on AWS/GCP/Azure to enable cross-device, multi-user accessibility.

Introduce auto-scaling for high-load scenarios (e.g., bulk verification or multiple extension users).

🔒 Authentication & Access Control

Implement role-based access for client and admin operations.

Add support for API keys or OAuth2 to secure the endpoints.

Allow personalized user history (e.g., "My past scans").

🤖 LLM Augmentation for Misinformation

Integrate retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) pipelines using vector databases (e.g., Weaviate, FAISS) for verifiable real-time search.

Let users “ask follow-up questions” about misinformation claims.

🧠 Explainable AI (XAI)

Integrate Grad-CAM or similar tools into DeepTracer to visualize fake regions for videos and images.

For misinformation, highlight fact-checked sentence spans and cited passages with source links.

🎥 Real-Time Browser Media Scanning

Upgrade browser extension with WebAssembly-based detection (e.g., for TensorFlow.js compatible models).

Enable background tab scanning of TikTok, Instagram Reels, or YouTube shorts.

📊 Analytics Dashboard

Create admin-level Streamlit dashboard showing:

Detection volume over time

Common misinformation categories

Most flagged social platforms or domains

🧩 Multi-Model Support

Allow user to switch between DeepTracer, FaceForensics, or custom-trained CNNs.

Let LLM routing select appropriate verifier models based on domain (e.g., medical misinformation → specialized model).

🛡️ Adversarial Robustness & Continuous Fine-Tuning

Continuously fine-tune the Deepfake model on new adversarial samples.

Implement prompt injection and adversarial robustness filters for the LLM.

🌍 Language & Region Support

Add multilingual support in both UI and LLM verification.

Tailor misinformation verification to region-specific news sources and regulations.

🧪 Open API for Developers

Offer a documented API for third-party apps to use our detection services.

Enable WhatsApp/Telegram bots to send media for real-time scanning.

[16/08/25, 12:17:04 PM] ~ Aaron Fritz: ‎~ Aaron Fritz pinned a message
[16/08/25, 12:17:22 PM] ~ Aaron Fritz: hell nah, start research today if we're taking this seriously
[16/08/25, 12:17:35 PM] ~ Aaron Fritz: I'll be occupied for most of the day but I'll try send whatever research i have
[16/08/25, 12:18:01 PM] ~ Aaron Fritz: what all do we have active rn, 

Cybercup and this right?
[16/08/25, 12:18:06 PM] ~ Aaron Fritz: any ai tasks pending?
[16/08/25, 12:18:09 PM] ~ Aaron Fritz: @919063011127
[16/08/25, 12:18:15 PM] ~ Aaron Fritz: Other than our research projects
[16/08/25, 12:18:43 PM] ~ Aaron Fritz: deprioritize cybercup for next week
[16/08/25, 12:18:45 PM] ~ Isha Sarvani: Helo I'm  travelling today
[16/08/25, 12:18:55 PM] ~ Aaron Fritz: fine we start work sunday
[16/08/25, 12:19:13 PM] ~ Isha Sarvani: I think it's on higher priority
[16/08/25, 12:19:19 PM] ~ Isha Sarvani: Talk to Addy ek baar
[16/08/25, 12:20:40 PM] ~ Aditya Ram: are y'all in campus or did you go home
[16/08/25, 12:25:24 PM] ~ Aaron Fritz: i went home dk about her
[16/08/25, 12:25:48 PM] ~ Aaron Fritz: we'll decide after gauging the feasibility of the task
[16/08/25, 12:26:17 PM] ~ Aaron Fritz: if it's actually feasible and we have a chance
[16/08/25, 12:26:30 PM] ~ Aaron Fritz: we go all in
[16/08/25, 12:26:53 PM] ~ Aaron Fritz: de prioritize doesn't mean ignore or avoid
[16/08/25, 12:27:07 PM] ~ Aaron Fritz: means it takes secondary preference during the duration
[16/08/25, 12:32:30 PM] ~ Aditya Ram: Fine sunday we'll hold a gmeet to decide work split and everything else that's required
[16/08/25, 12:33:03 PM] ~ Aaron Fritz: i think sunday 3 of us will likely meet in cryptonite
[16/08/25, 12:33:15 PM] ~ Aaron Fritz: if isha and sambhavit shows up
[16/08/25, 12:33:25 PM] ~ Aaron Fritz: wanna do it offline?
[16/08/25, 12:33:49 PM] ~ Aditya Ram: But you're at home rn no
[16/08/25, 12:34:18 PM] ~ Aditya Ram: I mean I don't mind meeting offline
[16/08/25, 12:35:28 PM] ~ Aaron Fritz: I'll be there for tomorrow meet
[16/08/25, 12:35:44 PM] ~ Aaron Fritz: I'll reach morning
[16/08/25, 12:35:48 PM] ~ Aaron Fritz: i leave tonight

[17/08/25, 5:31:02 PM] Sambhavit Anand: I’m at the airport right now, will reach monday early morning
[17/08/25, 5:32:29 PM] ~ Isha Sarvani: Good point
[17/08/25, 5:35:58 PM] ~ Aditya Ram: Initially I think we just need to have the same understanding of the ps
[17/08/25, 5:36:06 PM] ~ Aaron Fritz: works
[17/08/25, 5:36:13 PM] Sambhavit Anand: I’m down for a gmeet

[17/08/25, 11:51:46 PM] Sambhavit Anand: sorry ibus got fucked
[18/08/25, 12:04:14 AM] ~ Aditya Ram: @919063011127 are we deciding the work split rn?
[18/08/25, 12:04:44 AM] Sambhavit Anand: yes split it now and assign tasks
[18/08/25, 12:04:49 AM] Sambhavit Anand: someone take lead
[18/08/25, 12:05:36 AM] ~ Aditya Ram: i'd like one of you three to take lead
[18/08/25, 12:05:44 AM] ~ Isha Sarvani: - what framework to use for appdev
- What kind of Llm to use and why 
- piecing together everything how to tie things up between the app and working llm
[18/08/25, 12:06:09 AM] ~ Isha Sarvani: any changes
[18/08/25, 12:06:44 AM] ~ Aditya Ram: i don't mind doing appdev but the thing is i'd have to do it in parallel while you guys are fine tuning the LLM
[18/08/25, 12:06:59 AM] ~ Aditya Ram: i can't just do it separately
[18/08/25, 12:08:12 AM] Sambhavit Anand: yeah understandable
[18/08/25, 12:08:21 AM] ~ Isha Sarvani: yeah that makes
[18/08/25, 12:08:36 AM] Sambhavit Anand: let 2 people work on appdev so that everyone can be part of the main LLM tuning
[18/08/25, 12:09:28 AM] ~ Isha Sarvani: yeah
[18/08/25, 12:10:20 AM] ~ Aditya Ram: by the deadline we can just show it working for a pre existing dataset
[18/08/25, 12:10:31 AM] ~ Aditya Ram: if we get past the first round then we can fully implement it
[18/08/25, 1:17:19 PM] ~ Aditya Ram: You guys are going to be in ab4 at 5pm right
[18/08/25, 1:17:38 PM] ~ Aditya Ram: If you guys are discussing the hackathon asw I'll also pull up
[18/08/25, 1:36:36 PM] ~ Aaron Fritz: hey sorry for the inactivity, went to sleep
[18/08/25, 1:36:38 PM] ~ Aaron Fritz: tiring day
[18/08/25, 1:36:44 PM] ~ Aaron Fritz: will be there 5 pm
[18/08/25, 2:44:02 PM] ~ Aaron Fritz: assuming we're still on PS#5
[18/08/25, 2:44:28 PM] ~ Aaron Fritz: here's my take
- we need to look into how lora qlora works and how we can optim it for handheld models
- assess the hardware specs
- and see how we can make our protocol stand out
- and example would be a smaller ai model which tracks resource usage of the device, and run the training at times when resource usage is minimal (when the user goes to sleep, etc) ‎<This message was edited>
[18/08/25, 2:46:45 PM] ~ Aaron Fritz: idk how far we can mod the finetuning aspect, we'll have to use heavily quantized models
[18/08/25, 2:49:58 PM] ~ Aaron Fritz: also look into the concept of adapters in fine tuning
adapters in summary are like parts of the models vast params we actually "train"
[18/08/25, 2:50:46 PM] ~ Aaron Fritz: tiny trainable layers, if you will
[18/08/25, 2:53:00 PM] ~ Aaron Fritz: so an adapter protocol 
where adapters = small swappable modules
where each module can be used for a different aspect of user context
[18/08/25, 2:53:12 PM] ~ Aaron Fritz: we could train it on the users WhatsApp messaging styles
[18/08/25, 2:53:16 PM] ~ Aaron Fritz: now it can respond for you
[18/08/25, 2:53:19 PM] ~ Aaron Fritz: shit like that
[18/08/25, 2:53:22 PM] ~ Aaron Fritz: cool stuff
[18/08/25, 3:15:53 PM] ~ Aditya Ram: We'll have to pick a base model before fine tuning using qlora
[18/08/25, 3:16:34 PM] ~ Aaron Fritz: Mistral 7b instruct
[18/08/25, 3:16:37 PM] ~ Aaron Fritz: easy choice
[18/08/25, 3:16:40 PM] ~ Aaron Fritz: or wait
[18/08/25, 3:16:51 PM] ~ Aaron Fritz: Mistral 7b base
[18/08/25, 3:17:08 PM] ~ Aaron Fritz: We don't need instruct
[18/08/25, 4:46:16 PM] ~ Aditya Ram: I won't be coming at 5 I'm kinda busy
[18/08/25, 4:46:46 PM] ~ Aditya Ram: If you guys do discuss the ps or starting working on it could you please fill me in
[18/08/25, 4:47:20 PM] ~ Aaron Fritz: will do
[18/08/25, 4:49:24 PM] Sambhavit Anand: +1
[19/08/25, 4:41:47 PM] ~ Aditya Ram: Are we meeting?
[19/08/25, 4:42:07 PM] ~ Aaron Fritz: when?
[19/08/25, 4:43:51 PM] ~ Aaron Fritz: I'm gonna be out till 7
[19/08/25, 4:43:56 PM] ~ Aaron Fritz: I'm free after that
[19/08/25, 4:44:00 PM] ~ Aaron Fritz: also I did some research
[19/08/25, 4:44:22 PM] ~ Aaron Fritz: i think I'm close to plab
[19/08/25, 4:44:30 PM] ~ Aaron Fritz: I'll compile it all and send a written report
[19/08/25, 4:44:44 PM] ~ Aaron Fritz: online meet, or I'll pull up someplace offline
[19/08/25, 4:44:50 PM] ~ Aaron Fritz: sp or sm shit

[19/08/25, 4:47:41 PM] ~ Aaron Fritz: I'm still yet to verify all of this
[19/08/25, 4:47:54 PM] ~ Aaron Fritz: see what's existing comp, difficulty to implement, shit like that
‎[19/08/25, 4:49:22 PM] ~ Aaron Fritz: ‎<attached: 00000804-PHOTO-2025-08-19-16-49-23.jpg>
[19/08/25, 4:49:33 PM] ~ Aaron Fritz: we could sort of build this, in a week
[19/08/25, 4:49:41 PM] ~ Aaron Fritz: hope this makes sense

[19/08/25, 8:38:01 PM] ~ Aaron Fritz: god bless
[19/08/25, 8:38:10 PM] ~ Aaron Fritz: read when y'all get time, and by that i mean read now
[19/08/25, 8:38:28 PM] ~ Aaron Fritz: do exec summary, then tech stack + roadmap then finally ideation
[19/08/25, 8:38:38 PM] ~ Aaron Fritz: get a good understanding, gpt shit you don't understand
[19/08/25, 9:14:20 PM] ~ Aaron Fritz: any thoughts, like any reaction?
[19/08/25, 9:14:27 PM] ~ Aaron Fritz: how feasible does it sound
[19/08/25, 10:07:02 PM] ~ Aditya Ram: sounds feasible for the most part
[19/08/25, 10:07:41 PM] ~ Aditya Ram: if it's local do we really need strong encryption though?
[19/08/25, 10:10:42 PM] ~ Aditya Ram: i think the main thing are the adapters on which we'll apply qlora for fine tuning
[19/08/25, 10:11:09 PM] ~ Aaron Fritz: i think that was put in there cause of the ethics and arch md files
[19/08/25, 10:11:20 PM] ~ Aaron Fritz: like conceptually, we would need encryption
[19/08/25, 10:11:27 PM] ~ Aditya Ram: right now one person should make a dataset (small one for now)
[19/08/25, 10:11:40 PM] ~ Aditya Ram: we can do that after this first round
[19/08/25, 10:12:04 PM] ~ Aditya Ram: @919063011127 @918779635194 thoughts?
[19/08/25, 10:12:29 PM] Sambhavit Anand: will go over what is sent and get back to you guys

[21/08/25, 5:00:44 PM] ~ Isha Sarvani: Aajao
[21/08/25, 5:17:49 PM] ~ Isha Sarvani: - Front end ( chatting push to talk, flutter , luvable , )
- message goes to backend and we need to figure out got to do it on the machine 
- on board llm running 
- adapter protocol how to implement 
- showing stats in the front end ( how much time it took. When it happened )
- how to emulate the system 
- how to route and activate a certain adapter 
- concept of adapters
[21/08/25, 5:19:39 PM] ~ Isha Sarvani: - First priority, emulate the device 
- Llm 
- export data 
- train the llm to 
- frontend 
- emulation data extraction 
- preprocessing data 
- how the emulation works in the server 
- once this is done we can all work on the training
[21/08/25, 5:25:52 PM] ~ Isha Sarvani: Isha , @916366612244 : Look into LLM , How to build the Protocol , start to finish, scope out all possible errors and difficulties we might face and give it in a written report .
[21/08/25, 5:26:01 PM] ~ Isha Sarvani: Sambhavit - preprocessing
[21/08/25, 5:26:06 PM] ~ Isha Sarvani: Aaron - emulation
[21/08/25, 6:25:18 PM] ~ Aaron Fritz: we can emulate on the machine
[21/08/25, 6:25:18 PM] ~ Aaron Fritz: but
[21/08/25, 6:25:20 PM] ~ Aaron Fritz: sudo
[21/08/25, 6:25:23 PM] ~ Aaron Fritz: I need to make installs
[22/08/25, 10:19:54 AM] Sambhavit Anand: Where do you want me to extract the data from for the preprocessing
[22/08/25, 10:20:06 AM] Sambhavit Anand: I can then work on creating the file structure asw
‎[22/08/25, 8:02:16 PM] ~ Aditya Ram: LLM integration.docx • ‎4 pages ‎document omitted
[23/08/25, 6:07:03 PM] ~ Aaron Fritz: guys
[23/08/25, 6:07:10 PM] ~ Aaron Fritz: emulation is a bitch
[23/08/25, 6:07:14 PM] Sambhavit Anand: .
[23/08/25, 6:07:33 PM] ~ Aaron Fritz: ahhhhh, WhatsApp use one of your chats
[23/08/25, 6:07:52 PM] ~ Aaron Fritz: filter out all the sexting and sensitive info
[23/08/25, 6:08:05 PM] ~ Aaron Fritz: or use online existing dataset, if exists
[23/08/25, 6:08:19 PM] ~ Aaron Fritz: same goes for calander
[23/08/25, 6:08:25 PM] ~ Aaron Fritz: just use online datasets for all
[23/08/25, 6:09:28 PM] ~ Aaron Fritz: also another thing, 7b might be too much
[23/08/25, 6:09:40 PM] ~ Aaron Fritz: might have to settle for somthn 3+ near 4
